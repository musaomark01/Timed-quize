## Description
I created this web app to help me to study JavaScript concepts. The app features a 60-second timer and presents a set of four questions related to JavaScript. If a user answers a question correctly, they earn 5 points. However, if they answer incorrectly, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer.
The users have the option to input their initials after completing the quiz, and their scores can be saved to local storage.
